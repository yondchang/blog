My dream is to become a scientist when I was very young and after finishing my Ph.D. in bioinformatics(and a minor in statistics), I joined the scientific computing group at Amyris as a scientist and since then have been mainly working on the DARPA mgs to kgs program with the goal to genetically engineer strains to make 500+ small molecules. My main contribution is to automate existing workflow where intense manual labor is needed. This involves analyzing big phenotype data including metabolomics and proteomics from LC/MS and GC/MS. Meanwhile I write R/Python/F# programs for cPCR primer design, codon optimization, QTL and flux such as sugar uptake rate. Currently my main interest is machine learning especially applying deep neural networks to genotype and phenotype data.
