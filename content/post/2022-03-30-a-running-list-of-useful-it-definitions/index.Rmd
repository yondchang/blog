- DR: Data Recovery, often refers to recovery across different physical locations.
- RTO: Recovery Time Objective, i.e. time taken from start of recovery to completion, ideally 0 or instant recovery.
- RPO: Recovery Point Objective, i.e. until which day the data is recovered, ideally 0 or immediate recovered to latest data
