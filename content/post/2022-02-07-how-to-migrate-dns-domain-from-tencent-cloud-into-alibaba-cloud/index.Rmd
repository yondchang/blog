# Background
DNS registrar does not simply sell customer domain names, different registrars offer different features and pricing, e.g. Godaddy, Alibaba, Google etc, choosing a good reliable DNS registrar to host your precious company domain name is always a good idea. There are times when one needs to switch DNS registrar, e.g. change ownership of domain name, found a registrar with better pricing or better security. In this post I will go through the steps I took to transfer DNS domain name from Tencent cloud into Alibaba cloud.

## Step 1

Get transfer key from source cloud, in our case, follow
[instruction](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/9691) here.
Note domain name often can't be transferred if registered within past 60 days.

## Step 2
Type domain name and transfer key in destination DNS registrar (Alibaba cloud in our case) follow 
[instruction](https://wanwang.aliyun.com/domain/transfers) here.

## Step 3
Due to government regulations, all corporate domain names needs to go through background check before either initial registration or transfer. In our case one needs to register a information template (信息模板) before domain transfer.
This check will normally take 1 to 3 business days.

## Step 4(optional)
Step 3 failed but the website did not give us a reason, it only shows Incomplete info on register(注册者资料不完整). So I tried to reach out to online customer service but it is always busy and recommends me to call +86-95187, however that number seems not reachable from US. Finally I managed to get in touch with customer service and figured out the reason is the business license picture did not show all 4 corners clearly, problem solved!
