<h1>Background</h1>
<p>DNS registrar does not simply sell customer domain names, different registrars offer different features and pricing, e.g. Godaddy, Alibaba, Google etc, choosing a good reliable DNS registrar to host your precious company domain name is always a good idea. There are times when one needs to switch DNS registrar, e.g. change ownership of domain name, found a registrar with better pricing or better security. In this post I will go through the steps I took to transfer DNS domain name from Tencent cloud into Alibaba cloud, note not all domain types are supported, for example, Alicloud does not support .bio domain name tranfers yet.</p>
<div id="step-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Get transfer key from source cloud, in our case, follow
<a href="https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/9691">instruction</a> here.
Note domain name often can’t be transferred if registered within past 60 days.</p>

<h2>Step 2</h2>
<p>Type domain name and transfer key in destination DNS registrar (Alibaba cloud in our case) follow
<a href="https://wanwang.aliyun.com/domain/transfers">instruction</a> here.

<div id="step-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Due to government regulations, all corporate domain names needs to go through background check before either initial registration or transfer. In our case one needs to register a information template (信息模板) before domain transfer.
This check will normally take 1 to 3 business days.</p>

<h2>Step 4(optional)</h2>
<p>Step 3 failed but the website did not give us a reason, it only shows Incomplete info on register(注册者资料不完整). So I tried to reach out to online customer service but it is always busy and recommends me to call +86-95187, however that number seems not reachable from US. Finally I managed to get in touch with customer service and figured out the reason is the business license picture did not show all 4 corners clearly, problem solved!</p>
