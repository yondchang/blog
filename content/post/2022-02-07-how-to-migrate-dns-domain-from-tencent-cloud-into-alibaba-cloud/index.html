<h1>Background</h1>
<p>DNS registrar does not simply sell customer domain names, different registrars offer different features and pricing, choosing a good reliable DNS registrar to host your precious company domain name is always a good idea. There are times when one needs to switch DNS registrar, e.g. change ownership of domain name, found a registrar with better pricing or better security. In this post I will go through the steps I took to transfer DNS domain name from Tencent cloud into Alibaba cloud.</p>

<h2>Step 1</h2>
<p>Get transfer key from source cloud, in our case, follow

<h2>Step 3</h2>
<p>Due to government regulations, all corporate domain names needs to go through background check before either initial registration or transfer. In this case one needs to register a information template (信息模板) before domain transfer.
This check will normally take 1 to 3 business days.</p>
