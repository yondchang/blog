<p>Here is a list of useful definitions for Bioinformatics, it mainly
serves as a reference for myself but hopefully it will be useful for
other folks as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ANI/AAI: Average Nucleotide Identity/Average Amino-acid Identity</p></li>
<li><p>ANOSIM: ANalysis Of Similarities</p></li>
<li><p>ANOVA: Analysis of Variance</p></li>
<li><p>Correlation</p>
<ul>
<li>Pearson
<span class="math inline">\(r=\frac{\sum(X-\bar{X})(Y-\bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum(X-\bar{X})^2\sum(Y-\bar{Y})^2}}\)</span></li>
<li>Kendall
<span class="math inline">\(\tau=\frac{n_c-n_d}{n_c+n_d}=\frac{n_c-n_d}{n(n-1)/2}\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(n_c\)</span> is number of concordant pairs and <span class="math inline">\(n_d\)</span> is number of discordant pairs</li>
<li>Spearman
<span class="math inline">\(\rho=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(R(x_i)-\bar{R(x)})(R(y_i)-\bar{R(y)})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(R(x_i)-\bar{R(x)})^2\sum_{i=1}^{n}(R(y_i)-\bar{R(y)})^2}}\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(R(x_i)\)</span> is rank of <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R(y_i)\)</span> is rank of <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dimension reduction</p>
<ul>
<li>PCA is based on Euclidean distance, it is unsupervised and works well when inter-group difference is big and intra-group has relatively small difference.</li>
<li>PCOA is similar to PCA but based on non-Euclidean distance.</li>
<li>PLS is supervised, O stands for orthogonal and works well when sample size is small relative to feature numbers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Prokka: rapid prokaryotic genome annotation</p></li>
</ul>
